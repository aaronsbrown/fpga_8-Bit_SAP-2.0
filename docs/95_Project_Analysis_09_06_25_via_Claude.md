 Comprehensive Analysis of 8-Bit SAP-2 CPU Implementation

  Executive Summary

  This analysis examines a sophisticated FPGA-based 8-bit CPU implementation that significantly extends
  beyond the canonical SAP-2 architecture. The design demonstrates professional-grade engineering with
  comprehensive instruction set support, advanced peripheral integration, and extensive verification
  infrastructure. While maintaining educational accessibility, it incorporates features typically found in
  commercial microprocessors.

  1. Architecture Overview and Module Hierarchy

  Top-Level System Architecture (computer.sv)

  The system follows a clean Harvard-style architecture with memory-mapped I/O:

  // Memory mapping implementation
  assign ce_ram_8k = cpu_mem_address[15:13] == 3'b000;  // 0000–1FFF (8KB)
  assign ce_vram_4k = cpu_mem_address[15:12] == 4'b1101; // D000–DFFF (4KB)
  assign ce_mmio = cpu_mem_address[15:12] == 4'b1110;    // E000–EFFF (MMIO)
  assign ce_rom_4k = cpu_mem_address[15:12] == 4'b1111;  // F000–FFFF (4KB)

  Architectural Strengths:

- Clear modular separation: CPU, memory subsystems, and peripherals are well-isolated
- Standardized bus interface: 16-bit address, 8-bit data with unified read/write signals
- Professional memory mapping: Non-overlapping regions with decode logic
- Debug infrastructure: Comprehensive debug signals exposed for verification

  Memory Subsystem Design

  | Component | Address Range | Size | Purpose                |
  |-----------|---------------|------|------------------------|
  | RAM       | 0000-1FFF     | 8KB  | General purpose memory |
  | VRAM      | D000-DFFF     | 4KB  | Video/display buffer   |
  | MMIO      | E000-EFFF     | 4KB  | Peripheral registers   |
  | ROM       | F000-FFFF     | 4KB  | Program storage        |

  This memory map demonstrates excellent foresight for expansion and follows microcontroller conventions.

  2. CPU Core Components Analysis

  Control Unit (control_unit.sv)

  The control unit implements a sophisticated multi-cycle FSM supporting variable-length instructions:

  typedef enum logic [3:0] {
      S_RESET, S_STATIC_RESET_VEC, S_DYNAMIC_RESET_VEC_1, S_DYNAMIC_RESET_VEC_2,
      S_DYNAMIC_RESET_VEC_3, S_INIT_SP, S_LATCH_ADDR, S_READ_BYTE,
      S_LATCH_BYTE, S_CHK_MORE_BYTES, S_EXECUTE, S_HALT
  } fsm_state_t;

  Control Unit Strengths:

- Microcode ROM architecture: 256×10 control word array enabling complex instruction implementation
- Variable instruction length support: Automatic handling of 1, 2, and 3-byte instructions
- Configurable reset behavior: Compile-time selection between static (F000) and dynamic (FFFC/FFFD) reset
  vectors
- Conditional execution: Sophisticated flag testing for branch instructions
- ALU operation latching: Ensures stable ALU control throughout instruction execution

  Notable Design Decisions:

- Empty descending stack: SP points to next free location, grows downward from 01FF
- Microcode organization: Each instruction mapped to specific microstep sequences
- Flag-based branching: Direct flag testing in microcode without additional logic

  ALU Implementation (alu.sv)

  The ALU supports comprehensive 8-bit operations with proper flag generation:

  typedef enum logic [$clog2(MAX_MICROSTEPS)-1:0] {
      ALU_UNDEFINED, ALU_ADD, ALU_SUB, ALU_AND, ALU_OR, ALU_INR,
      ALU_DCR, ALU_ADC, ALU_SBC, ALU_XOR, ALU_INV, ALU_ROL, ALU_ROR
  } alu_op_t;

  ALU Analysis:

- Complete operation set: Arithmetic, logical, increment/decrement, and rotate operations
- Proper flag handling: Accurate Zero, Negative, and Carry flag generation
- Carry semantics: Correctly implements carry=1 for no-borrow in subtraction
- Register latching: Output values properly registered for timing closure

  Status Logic Unit (status_logic_unit.sv)

  This module demonstrates sophisticated flag management:

  // Complex flag logic for different instruction types
  if(load_sets_zn_in) begin
      zero_flag_out = loaded_data_is_zero;
      negative_flag_out = loaded_data_is_neg;
  end else begin
      unique case (alu_op_in)
          ALU_INR, ALU_DCR: begin  // Preserve carry flag
              zero_flag_out = alu_zero_in;
              negative_flag_out = alu_negative_in;
          end
          // ... other cases
      endcase
  end

  Flag Logic Strengths:

- ISA-compliant flag behavior: Different instructions affect flags according to specifications
- Preservation logic: INR/DCR correctly preserve carry flag
- Explicit control: SEC/CLC provide direct flag manipulation

  3. Instruction Set Implementation and ISA Compliance

  | Stack         | PHA, PLA, PHP, PLP             | Stack manipulation       |
  | Status        | SEC, CLC                       | Flag control             |

  microcode_rom[JSR][MS1] = '{default: 0, sp_dec: 1};
  microcode_rom[JSR][MS2] = '{default: 0, oe_pc_high_byte: 1};
  microcode_rom[JSR][MS3] = '{default: 0, oe_pc_high_byte: 1, load_ram: 1};
  // ... continues through MS9

  Microcode Strengths:
