# CPU Project Progress Report

**Date:** June 4, 2025 (Please update to the actual current date)

**Based On:** Completion of Assembler (Phase 4), near completion of UART (Phase 5), significant advancements in Stack & Subroutine Support (Phase 6), and major enhancements to the testing toolchain.

**Overall Summary:**
The project continues its strong trajectory. The robust two-pass assembler (Phase 4) is complete and actively used. Phase 5 (UART I/O) is nearly finalized, with advanced error handling (Frame, Overshoot) implemented and verified in simulation.

**Phase 6 (Stack & Subroutine Support)** has seen substantial progress, with the hardware implementation of the 16-bit Stack Pointer, datapath modifications, and microcode for core stack (`PHA`, `PLA`) and subroutine (`JSR`/`CALL`, `RET`) instructions completed and tested. Processor Status push/pop (`PHP`, `PLP`) have also been implemented and verified. The ISA has been refined with explicit Carry flag control (`SEC`, `CLC`) and associated conditional jumps.

Significant effort has also gone into improving the development and testing toolchain. This includes:

* A new Python script (`assemble_test.py`) for templating testbenches and assembling test-specific `.hex` fixtures.
* Refinement of the `simulate.sh` script for robust single-test execution, now mandating `sv2v` preprocessing.
* A new Python script (`run_tests.py`) for automated batch execution of all testbenches, providing comprehensive test reports.
* Restructuring of the test directory for better organization (`instruction_set`, `cpu_control`, `modules`).
* Standardization of testbench completion messages.
* Addition of an `instruction_finished` pulse signal from the CPU for improved testbench synchronization.

These tooling enhancements provide a solid foundation for ongoing development and regression testing.

## Critical Next Steps

1. **Finalize Phase 6 (Stack & Subroutine Support):**
    * **Documentation:** Update ISA documents (`0_ISA.md`) and CPU datasheets for all new instructions (`PHA`, `PLA`, `JSR`, `RET`, `PHP`, `PLP`, `SEC`, `CLC`, `JC`, `JNC`) and the stack pointer's behavior.
    * Ensure all testbenches (especially older ones in `instruction_set/`) are updated to use the new `wait(cpu_instr_complete)` synchronization and have standardized "finished" messages for `run_tests.py`.
    * Address any remaining test failures in `run_tests.py`.
2. **Review and Plan Phase 7 (Monitor Program):**
    * Design monitor commands and functionality.
    * Plan reset vector implementation.
3. **(Ongoing) Hardware Testing:** Continue to periodically synthesize and test key functionality on the FPGA as major features are completed.
