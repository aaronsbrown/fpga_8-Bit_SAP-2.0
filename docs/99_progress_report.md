# CPU Project Progress Report

**Date:** [Insert Current Date - e.g., October 26, 2023]

**Based On:** Completion of Assembler (Phase 4) and significant progress in UART Peripheral Integration (Phase 5), including advanced error handling.

**Overall Summary:**
The project has made substantial advancements, successfully completing the robust two-pass assembler (Phase 4), which now enables efficient programming for the established 16-bit address space and multi-byte instruction set (from Phase 3).
Significant progress has been made in **Phase 5 (Basic I/O Peripheral Integration)** with the implementation and thorough testing of a UART peripheral. This UART now supports:

* Basic serial transmission and reception.
* A level-sensitive `RX_DATA_READY` flag.
* Detection and status reporting for **Frame Errors** and **Overshoot/Overrun Errors**.
* A memory-mapped **Command Register** allowing CPU-driven clearing of these error flags.
Comprehensive testbenches and assembly programs have been developed to validate these UART features, including forcing and correctly handling error conditions. The MMIO infrastructure continues to prove effective. The CPU system is evolving into a capable platform with foundational communication abilities.

## Critical Next Steps

1. **Finalize Phase 5 (UART):**
    * Develop and test a **robust echo assembly program** that correctly handles good data, frame errors, and overshoot errors (e.g., by echoing specific characters or logging to an output port and then clearing errors).
    * Perform comprehensive **hardware testing** of the UART (including the robust echo and potentially trying to induce errors) with an external serial terminal.
    * Update UART datasheet (markdown) to v0.2. **(Done)**
    * Once confident, tag a release for Phase 5 completion.
2. **Begin Phase 6 (Stack & Subroutine Support):**
    * Design and implement `stack_pointer.sv` (16-bit).
    * Integrate SP into `cpu.sv`.
    * Implement microcode for stack operations (e.g., `PHA`, `PLA` - if adding to ISA) and subroutine instructions (`CALL`/`JSR`, `RET`/`RTS`).
    * Update assembler to support new stack/subroutine mnemonics.
    * Create testbenches.
3. **Documentation (Phase 4 - Assembler):**
    * Complete the formal documentation for the assembler's syntax and directives.
